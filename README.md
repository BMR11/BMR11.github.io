I love building things that connect â€” especially when it comes to **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** and **cross-platform mobile apps**. Whether it's integrating medical devices or building robust app features, I'm all about creating smooth, reliable, and scalable tech that actually makes life easier.
